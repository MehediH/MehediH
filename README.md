I am Mehedi, a sofware engineer and CompSci undergrad who loves to build fun experiences. I recently worked as an intern on the Windows on Snapdragon team at Qualcomm, helping build new experiences for next-gen Windows devices. On the side, I am working on projects like [Tweeten](https://tweetenapp.com) and [winstall.app](https://github.com/MehediH/winstall). At the moment, I am looking for grad and intern positions for 2021. 

🌱  &nbsp;&nbsp;I’m currently learning: Machine Learning, Hadoop/Spark, Computer Graphics w/ OpenGL, GLSL, and WebGL. 

👯  &nbsp;&nbsp;I’m looking to collaborate on anything fun :)
