I am Mehedi, a sofware engineer and CompSci undergrad who loves to build fun experiences. I am currently working as an intern on the Windows on Snapdragon team at Qualcomm, helping build new experiences for next-gen Windows devices. On the side, I am working on projects like [Tweeten](https://tweetenapp.com) and [winstall.app](https://github.com/MehediH/winstall).

🌱  &nbsp;&nbsp;I’m currently learning: C#, C++, and building native Win32/UWP apps.

👯  &nbsp;&nbsp;I’m looking to collaborate on building fun software experiences.
